And so we could do the same procedure again, using the now-known position and velocity at moment 2 (and the acceleration) to find the position and velocity at moment 3.  And then we could do it again, and again, and again... stepping our way forward in time to generate as many dots as we might want.\n",

        "\n",
        "There is one subtlety that we should pause to consider.  In this section, we've been thinking of velocities as associated with specific moments.  For example, we got started by assuming we were given $\\vec{v}_1$, the velocity of the ball *at* moment 1, and then, by going through this updating procedure, we worked our way up to knowing the velocity $\\vec{v}_n$ *at* moment n.  That is, the velocities we've been working with here are *instantaneous velocities*.\n",
        "\n",
        "But, strictly speaking, the last few equations are only true if the velocities are *average velocities* -- not the velocities *at* specific moments, but the average velocities for the time intervals *between* moments.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Does this make a difference?  Yes!  If the velocity is changing (and... if there's acceleration... it is!) the instantaneous velocity at some moment will not be the same as the average velocity during a time interval starting at that moment.  But... if the velocity isn't changing very fast... or, equivalently, if we consider $\\Delta t$, the time interval between one moment and the next, to be very small, then the velocity won't change very much during the time interval, and the instantaneous velocity at the beginning of the time interval will be a very good approximation to the average velocity during the time interval.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Note also that this same discussion applies also, in exactly the same way, to the other part of our algorithm:  using the given acceleration to \"update\" the velocity.  We can rearrange the definition of (average!) acceleration\n",

        "$$\\vec{a} = \\dfrac{\\Delta \\vec{v}}{\\Delta t}$$\n",

If (as in the example we've been working with) the acceleration is *constant*, then this average acceleration will be the same as the instantaneous acceleration at moment n.  So for this particular example, our \"update rule\" for velocities will be exact.  But in some other examples we'll consider later, the acceleration may not be constant, and then our update rule will be only approximately true... but the approximation will be better the smaller we make $\\Delta t$.  \n",
        "\n",
        "To summarize, the algorithm we're developing here is not perfectly accurate.  But we can make it as accurate as we want by making $\\Delta t$ small.  So there's a trade-off between accuracy and work.  If (say) we want to figure out where the ball is after one second, we could get that answer by taking a single step with $\\Delta t = 1 \\, \\text{sec}$.  But that won't be very accurate!  We could make it more accurate by taking $\\Delta t = 0.2 \\, \\text{sec}$, but then we'd have to take 5 steps forward in time.  Or by taking 50 steps with $\\Delta t = 0.02 \\, \\text{sec}$ we could find the location of the ball after one second even *more* accurately.  You get the idea.  The point is, to achieve good accuracy, we're going to want to take little tiny baby steps (instead of just a few giant leaps).  But that means taking *lots* of steps, which will get really tedious and labor-intensive if we're doing it all by hand.  \n",
