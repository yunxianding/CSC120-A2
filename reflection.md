Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment. 

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Overall, I think this is a really interesting assignment.
Instead of writing procedural programs that we are familiar with, 
we are asked to use objected oriented programming.
I feel like the hardest part for me is to assign which functions each class should do.
At first I feel like function should be stored in the resailshop except for
the basic information about the computer,
but then I realize that I can put update price and update OS in computer class.
Through some trials and errors, I finally figured out how to do it
and I have examined it with the rubric.
An advice I would give someone taking this course in the future is that 
programming really trains your logic thinking.
Taking this assignment as an example, we are provided with basically all the 
code that we need, but we have to carefully divide them and
rewrite them into another form, which really tests our thinking ability.
